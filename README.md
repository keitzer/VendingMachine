# VendingMachine
Vending machine kata, from here: https://github.com/guyroyse/vending-machine-kata

First 3 features implemented using TDD.

# Requirements
```
Xcode
Cocoapods
```

# How To Install
```
checkout
cd (dir)
pod install
open xcworkspace file
```

# How to run tests
```
Cmd+U 
or
Product -> Test
```

# Notes
Please be patient when the tests run. There are a few that rely on a 2-second timer, and so it takes about 10-12 seconds in total to run through all of them. The tests run pretty instantly, with the exception of the aforementioned delayed tests.
